# LEX

## Abstract
The aim of this research is to open up the power of Linked Data to non-Computer Scientists. Linked Data is a method of describing data that includes how the data interlinks with itself and other datasets using web standards. By the nature of Linked Data, there is the opportunity for patterns to arise which could potentially provide new insights into data that would have otherwise been missed. While Linked Data can be used in any discipline, there is currently a disconnect between the end user (a domain expert) and the Linked Dataset itself. There is often a reliance on computer scientists to provide a means of exploring the dataset. This reduces the potential value of the dataset as there is an intermediary. LEX provides a \textsl{generic} solution to that problem by introducing the concept of using metadata to define the structure of a Linked Dataset in VoID. The resulting interface has been well received by domain experts in the health discipline.
